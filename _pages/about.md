PhD Student in Agricultural Economics at Purdue University â€” Website under construction. 

 My research focuses on food economics, health economics, and industrial organization in food markets. More specifically, my work explores the relationships among food manufacturers, retailers, and nutritional health. Key aspects of these interactions include food labeling, product assortments, and price discrimination. I also examine how supply in the food industry responds to changes in food policy. My work has focused on the food and beverage industries, including fresh food, processed food, and alcoholic products.
