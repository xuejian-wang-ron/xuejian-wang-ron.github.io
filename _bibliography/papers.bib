	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show the impact of digital agriculture on food supply chain, research trend, emphasis and implications for future research.The paper analyzes how the digital technology reshapes the production, assembly, transaction, retail and logistics. Impact from each main technological progress is discussed.First, digital agriculture develops quickly and changes all parts of the food supply chain. Second, while many technological progresses show their impacts in agriculture and food sector, e-commerce and progress of artificial intelligence show its comprehensive impact on the argi-food sector.The paper shows the technological trend and progress in food and agriculture sector. Researchers focusing on agricultural economics and agribusiness should pay attention to recent developments in the real world, know the recent developments from other disciplines, get more data for empirical research and show the impact of digital agriculture on consumer's preference and social welfare.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements, such as online grocery shopping, have significantly transformed consumer retail environments and experiences. Effectively studying consumer behavior in these new environments requires the use of novel methodological approaches, which will also aid in developing interventions to encourage sustainable consumption. This paper begins by providing an overview of the current literature on novel approaches to analyzing consumer behavior, then provides an empirical application by examining consumer decision-making pathways within an online grocery shopping platform. Specifically, the paper focuses on exploring the consumers' digital footprints, such as page visits, product additions and removals, and interactions with information labels to identify patterns and interests in consumer responses to healthy and sustainable consumption. Findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating consumer search tracking data with environmental design to facilitate informed and conscious food choices.},
